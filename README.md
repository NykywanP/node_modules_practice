# Node Modules Practice

- [X] Fork and clone this repo
- [X] Initialize node in your cloned repo so it becomes a node project!

## Make your own module

- [X] Create a node module that stores an array of your favorite foods
- [X] Import that module into your `index.js`
- [X] Write code in your `index.js` so when you run your app, it loops through the array, printing all of your favorite foods to the console

## Experiment with implementing a package

- [X] Find 3 [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages that look interesting
- [X] Experiment with incorporating them into this node project, just like we did with moment

## Add to your Node app instructions readme

- [X] Add notes about how to create and import node modules to your Node/Express app readme, along with instructions about adding a `.gitignore`
- [X] Paste the link to your repo in this the readme of this assignment

## Finally, .gitignore and submit a PR!

- [X] Add a `.gitignore` to this assignment, so the `node_modules` folder doesn't upload to Github
- [X] Submit this assignment by making a `pull request`



## How I added Node apps to this project.
I went to ```https://www.npmjs.com/``` to download 3 new packages.
The first packages was an extenson ```ext @ npm i ext```. The second package was an function package ```@ npm i function-call-chain```. The last but not less was a boilerplate ```@ npm i boilerplate-gen```.
